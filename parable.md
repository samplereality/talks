# Afrofuturism
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->


“Afrofuturism” coined by cultural critic Mark Dery in a 1994 essay and set of interviews called “Black to the Future”<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left" -->


“African Americans, in a very real sense, are the descendants of alien abductees; they inhabit a sci-fi nightmare in which unseen but no less impassable force fields of intolerance frustrate their movements; official histories undo what has been done; and technology is too often brought to bear on black bodies (branding, forced sterilization, the Tuskegee experiment, and tasers”<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left" -->


“Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out…imagine possible futures?”<!-- .slide: style="text-align: left" -->



# Hallmarks of Afrofuturism
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->


Reintegrates people of color into science fiction and pop culture


Combines pop culture, science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, magic realism, and non-Western or African-centric experiences


Imagining possible futures in a way that centers blackness and black experiences


Explores role of science and technology in black lives


Thinks through the implications of W.E.B. DuBois’ idea of “double-consciousness” in the digital age


Draws parallels between transatlantic slave trade and contemporary and futuristic power relations


Imagines utopias set apart from the everyday dystopia of black lives
